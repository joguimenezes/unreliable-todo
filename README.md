### Process to develop:

After understanding the challenge, I developed the layout using Adobe Xd (https://xd.adobe.com/spec/01bb068f-258e-448f-7206-1b9895507bef-778a/grid) so that I would know better how to architect the components and show how can i build identically a layout.

After that, I created my task planning using KanbanFlow and then started developing =)
